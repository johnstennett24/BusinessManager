# Overview

I am using this app to learn more about app development in the Flutter language and how to use it better.

This app is a first version of a business management app that helps managers to think and come up with creative ideas for helping run the business.
The main problem with managers is that they might think of themselves as employees and not as managers. Managers need to be able to think and make decisions that benefit the business. With goal setting and daily reflection of those goals through this app we are able to help them achieve that vision.

I have created this software for two reasons. On is to learn the Flutter framework and to see how powerful it really is. Two is to help the small business people of the world to better inspire their managers and how they run their stores or respective businesses.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

This was developed using Android Studio on a Macbook Pro with an M1 Pro Chip.

# About the language

This app as of now uses the Dart programming language inside the Flutter framework. Dart is a general purpose programming language developed by Google. I am working on a WebAPI in C# that refernces a MySQL database that is more powerful than the current usage of Firebase Firestore and can help to make it easier and more performant to work with data inside the app.

# Useful Websites

The main Flutter page has a lot of codelabs and cookbooks that you can look at to help get started using Flutter and Dart and getting used to Widgets and the Dart Syntax.
